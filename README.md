# Viktor-s-Blog

please use update-database in PMC before starting to create database. :)

This is my project defence for SoftUni's C# MVC Frameworks course. Otherwise this is a simple blog with some added admin and moderator functionality. I tried keeping the code as clean as possible, reusing view when possible.
I will continue on expanding the blog as I continue to learn and maybe someday It will be published to the internet for everyone to visit. :)
